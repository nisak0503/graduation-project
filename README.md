# graduation-project
This is a graduation project for my college life. I want to first develop a IOS APP which can detect bad road conditions such as potholes and speed bumps. After that, ... let's see what I can do. :)

This is a developing log.

May 22nd
Finished basic functions and is approved by Dr. Quan Chen, my dear mentor.
However, there are some bugs about robustness need to be fixed. I'll fix them later in early June after I finished my poster and graduate thesis. 
These bugs are...

1. Users cannot change the destination after they navigate once. This is because the annotations and the polylines are not removed and Go buttons should evoke the navigation again.
2. Click "Best" button after "Go" button, the APP performs normally. However, pressing "Go" twice and then "Best" will not remove the extra routes. This is strange and I have no clue currently.

To Be Fixed!

July 7th
Fixed 1st one already in June.


Today, I'm going to check and hand my code in.
